# BreakerBox
 
BreakerBox is a small utility module in an OOP construct that simplifies connection management and control for connections (in bulk) that frequently reappear yet benefit from periodic interruption. This allows you to manage active connections in a clean and coherent way while also mitigating memory leaks.  It increase organization and facilitates better memory management, while remaining distinct from Maid and Janitor classes/implementations.
